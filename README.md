This code will be run on Jupyter notebook
This project focuses on predicting MPG (Miles Per Gallon) of a vehicle using machine learning techniques.
MPG indicates a vehicle’s fuel efficiency and is an important factor in automobile performance analysis.

The model is trained using key vehicle specifications such as cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, and acceleration to accurately estimate fuel efficiency.

📊 Dataset Features
The following input features are used to train the model:

Cylinders – Number of engine cylinders
Displacement – Engine displacement (cubic inches)
Horsepower – Engine power output
Weight – Vehicle weight
Acceleration – Time taken to accelerate

🎯 Target Variable
MPG (Miles Per Gallon) – Fuel efficiency of the vehicle
